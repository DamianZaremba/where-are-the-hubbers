Where are the 'hubbers?
=======================

This repo contains 2 parts:
1) Simple script to pull the hubbers from the GH team page,
grab their location info from the API if provided and
dump it to a json file.

2) Basic html/js google map that loads the json info from the
first script and presents a map of hubber locations with a quick
nick/avatar/name popup on click

Most the code is very badly written - I just wanted a quick way to visualise
the spread for personal reasons.

Feel free to send some PRs and make it sexy like!
